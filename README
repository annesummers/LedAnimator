This is LedAnimator, an application written in Qt C++ to create animations for displaying on banks of RBG LEDs.

The application allows the user to create an animation which can then be written out to file; another piece of software running on an embedded processor attached to a physical bank of LEDs is required to read the file and display the contents on the LEDs.

The format the animations are written out in is as follows (each value is a byte):

Header byte 0x56
Number of LEDs high value
Number of LEDs low value
Number of rows
Number of columns
Unused byte
Unused byte
Number of frames
Frame frequency
FOREACH frame
    LED Number
    Hue high value
    Hue Low value
    Saturation
    Value
Terminating Byte 0x45

If any value aside from the header byte or the terminating byte share their values the value is escaped using the value 0x02
